# CLAUDE.md — Stroke Off

Project context for Claude Code. Read this first, every session. The full product spec is the source of truth at **`docs/strokeoff-spec.md`** — when this file and the spec disagree, the spec wins; update this file to match.

## What we're building

**Stroke Off** is an installable PWA for a points-based disc golf side-game that runs parallel to a regular round. Players log points when conditions are met; at round end, total points convert to stroke deductions on the regular score, producing an adjusted final. Rounds are **shared and real-time** (multiple phones, one live round). See spec §1.

## Stack (decided — don't re-litigate)

- **React + Vite + TypeScript**, built as a **PWA** (`vite-plugin-pwa`). TS is the default for this data-model-heavy app; flag in chat if you want to drop to JS.
- **Tailwind** for layout/structure utilities only.
- **Theme tokens as CSS custom properties** drive all color/typography — see Architecture below.
- **Supabase** — Postgres, Auth (anonymous + magic-link), Realtime, Storage, Edge Functions.
- **TanStack Query** for server state; Supabase Realtime subscriptions for live round data.
- **React Router** for the five-tab navigation.
- **`html-to-image`** for client-side scorecard PNG export.
- **Resend** (via a Supabase Edge Function) for the transactional guest claim email. Supabase Auth sends magic-link login emails.
- **Deploy:** Netlify, target `dabingabongo.com/strokeoff`.
- **Tests:** Vitest + React Testing Library for logic (scoring, conversion, tie-breaks).

## Architecture principles (non-negotiable)

These ripple through everything; get them right from Phase 0.

1. **Theme = data, not code.** Every visual surface (lobby, live scoring, animations, scorecards) reads from **theme tokens** (CSS custom properties). Never hardcode a color or font in a component. A new theme is a new token bundle dropped into the registry — no component edits. See spec §13. The registry ships ~21 themes.
2. **Snapshot to preserve history.** When a round starts, snapshot its **conversion**, **theme**, and (per event) the **rule name + point value**. Editing a rule/conversion/theme later must never rewrite a completed round. See spec §7, §8, §13.
3. **RLS-first.** Every table gets Row Level Security from the migration that creates it — never ship a table open. Round participants read/write that round's data (writes scoped to subjects they control); group members manage their group's rules/conversion/theme; completed rounds are visible to participants + group members. See spec §14.
4. **Realtime model.** One round = one set of Supabase Realtime subscriptions (Postgres changes on `point_events` / `round_players`, plus presence for the lobby). Live totals are derived from events, not stored counters.
5. **Permission on writes.** You may log/edit points only for subjects you control: yourself (Multi Phone), or any subject as the controller / a managed guest (Single Phone). Enforce in both UI and RLS.
6. **Offline-tolerant writes.** Point events are append-only with a **client-generated UUID**, written optimistically and reconciled on reconnect (full offline queue lands in its own phase, but design for it from the start — never assume a counter, always derive from events).
7. **Login optional, never required.** Anonymous play works fully; magic-link is an upgrade that links in place. Group membership and avatars/messages are login-only.

## Repo conventions

- **Structure (suggested):**
  ```
  src/
    routes/        one folder per tab (home, round, rules, history, community)
    features/      domain logic (scoring, conversion, tiebreak, themes, guests)
    components/    shared UI primitives (token-driven)
    lib/           supabase client, query hooks, realtime helpers
    themes/        theme token bundles + registry
    types/         shared TS types (mirror the spec §14 data model)
  supabase/
    migrations/    SQL incl. RLS policies
    functions/     edge functions (email, claim)
  docs/
    strokeoff-spec.md
  ```
- **Styling:** Tailwind for layout; **all color/type via CSS variables** from the active theme. No hex/`text-*color*` literals in components. Sentence case in UI copy.
- **Types mirror the data model.** Keep `src/types` aligned with spec §14; update both together.
- **Naming:** components `PascalCase`, hooks `useThing`, files match export.
- **Accessibility:** real labels, focus states, ≥44px tap targets, works one-handed on a phone outdoors.

## Build workflow

Build **one phase at a time** in order (spec §15). Each phase:
1. Branch/worktree per phase (e.g. `phase-3-round-setup`).
2. Build only that phase's scope — **resist pulling later phases forward.** If something's needed early, stub it minimally and note it.
3. Hit the phase's **Deliverable** (the acceptance criterion in the spec).
4. `pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm test` clean before calling it done.
5. Commit with a clear message; summarize what shipped and what's stubbed.

Phase 0 is scaffold + the **theme-token architecture** + five-tab shell + Supabase wiring + Netlify deploy. Start there (see `PHASE-0-KICKOFF.md`).

## Commands

```
pnpm dev          # local dev
pnpm build        # production build
pnpm preview      # preview the build
pnpm typecheck    # tsc --noEmit
pnpm lint         # eslint
pnpm test         # vitest
npx supabase ...  # migrations / local stack
```

## Environment

Copy `.env.example` → `.env.local`. Never commit secrets.
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` — client.
- `RESEND_API_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — server-side only (Edge Functions), never exposed to the client.

## Definition of done (every phase)

Typechecks, lints, tests pass; the phase Deliverable is demonstrably true; RLS exists on any new table; no hardcoded colors; nothing from a later phase pulled in without a note.
